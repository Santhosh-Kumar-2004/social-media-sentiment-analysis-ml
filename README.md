# Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Data

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes sentiments from social media posts to determine whether the expressed opinions are **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**.  
It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques to process raw text data, train sentiment classification models, and visualize trends.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Project?
- Social media is filled with user opinions that influence public perception.
- Businesses, governments, and individuals can benefit from understanding public sentiment.
- Helps in **brand monitoring**, **market research**, and **trend analysis**.

## ðŸ›  Problem It Solves
Currently, most social media platforms have **massive unstructured text data**, making it difficult to understand public opinion quickly.  
Our project solves this by:
- Automatically classifying opinions as positive, negative, or neutral.
- Providing insights through visualizations.
- Offering a foundation for real-time sentiment dashboards.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Data cleaning & preprocessing pipeline
- Machine Learning-based sentiment classification
- Accuracy & performance evaluation
- Sentiment distribution visualizations
- Easily expandable for multiple languages & social media platforms
